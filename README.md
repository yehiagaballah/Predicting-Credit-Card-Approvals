# Predicting-Credit-Card-Approvals
Hey There, 

This project is a part of a series of projects on [Datacamp.com](https://learn.datacamp.com/) for Data Science with Python [Career Track](https://learn.datacamp.com/career-tracks/data-scientist-with-python?version=5)

It is a guided project offering the datasets and what kind of analysis is needed with them while allowing you to perform the code that executes these functions.

In the End, it offers a series of tests to make sure the output the code generates matches what is expected of the output.

This project utilizes scikit learn to predict whether a credit card application would be approaved or not based on the data of previous customers data and the banks' decision of approaving the card or refusal
